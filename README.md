## 🎮 How to Play
- **Start** the game by pressing the `Spacebar` or the `Arrow Up` key.
- **Flap** to keep the bird flying and avoid hitting the pipes or falling off the screen.
- **Score** points by successfully passing through the pairs of pipes.
- **Game Over** if you collide with a pipe or fall down.

## ✨ Features
- Smooth, physics-based bird movement
- Randomly generated pipe obstacles
- Gravity and jump physics
- Scoring system
- "Game Over" message display
- Fully responsive canvas for different screen sizes
- Classic Flappy Bird visuals with custom images

## 🛠️ Built With
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**

## 📋 How It Works
- **Canvas Setup**: A `<canvas>` element is used to render the game.
- **Bird Mechanics**: Gravity constantly pulls the bird down, and pressing the jump key applies an upward force.
- **Pipe Generation**: Pipes are randomly placed at intervals and move towards the bird.
- **Collision Detection**: If the bird touches any pipe or goes off-screen, the game ends.
- **Game Loop**: The game uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth updates.
